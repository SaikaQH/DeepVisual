# DeepVisual

DeepVisual, a visual programming tool for designing and applying DL systems. DeepVisual represents each layer in neural networks as a  component, so that users can drag-and-drop  componentsto design and build a DL model for their own purposes, and automatically generate the corresponding training code. Moreover, DeepVisual can also generate the architectural graphcomposed by corresponding components via  parsing compiledneural network code. 

After installing in PyCharm, you can find DeepVisual in Tool menu --> DeepVisual.
